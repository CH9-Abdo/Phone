## 🚀 How to Run

Since this is a static website, you don't need a complex backend server.

1.  **Open locally:**
    Simply double-click `index.html` to open it in your web browser.

2.  **Using a local server (Recommended):**
    If you have Python installed, you can run a simple server to avoid CORS issues with images:
    ```bash
    python3 -m http.server 8000
    ```
    Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

## 🛠️ How to Manage Products

We have provided a custom Python tool to make managing your inventory easy.

### Using `admin_manager.py`
This is a graphical interface to add, edit, or remove phones from the database (`js/phones_data.js`) without touching code.

1.  **Run the tool:**
    ```bash
    python3 admin_manager.py
    ```
    *(Note: You may need to update this script to point to `js/phones_data.js` instead of `js/script.js` since we split the files).*

### Using `phone_downloader.py`
Need images for new phones? This tool automatically searches GSMArena and downloads high-quality images.

1.  **Run the tool:**
    ```bash
    python3 phone_downloader.py
    ```
2.  Type the phone name (e.g., "Samsung S24").
3.  Click Download.
4.  The images will be saved in the `Photos` folder.

## 💻 Developers

### Adding a new phone manually
Open `js/phones_data.js` and add a new object to the `products` array:

```javascript
{
    id: 46, // Unique ID
    name: "New Phone Name",
    brand: "Brand Name",
    price: 50000,
    image: "Photos/image_name.jpg",
    rating: 4.5,
    specs: {
        screen: "6.5\" AMOLED", // Note: Escape quotes inside strings!
        refresh: "120Hz",
        ram: "8GB",
        storage: "256GB",
        camera: "50MP",
        battery: "5000mAh",
        processor: "Snapdragon",
        network: "5G"
    }
},
```
